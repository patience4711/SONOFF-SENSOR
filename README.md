# SONOFF-SENSOR
The sonoff is a very intersting device and has the possibility to install custom software. This way we can make use of another feature: We can connect sensors like f.i a BME 280. Now we can setup a thermostate or a hydrostate.  With this program installed on a Sonoff it is very easy to do that. 
The only thing you have to do is connect a sensor and make some adjustments in the settings, done via the webinterface.
The software has some interesting features:
- actual sensor readings are displayed on the frontpage
- Simply to connect to your wifi
- data can be requested via http and mosquitto
- Fast asyc webserver with a intuitive webinterface.
- Smart timekeeping.
- A lot of system info on the webinterface.
- switch based on sensor readings, manual or via 4 timers
